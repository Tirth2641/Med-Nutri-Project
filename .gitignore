Okay, I see your folder structure. Based on this, here's a good starting point for your .gitignore file to exclude common project-related files and directories that you likely don't want to track in Git, especially for a Python-based project:

# IntelliJ IDEA related files
.idea/

# Virtual Environment
.venv/
venv/

# Python bytecode
__pycache__/
*.pyc

# OS Specific files (can be added globally if you prefer)
.DS_Store      # macOS
Thumbs.db      # Windows

# Log files
*.log

# Editor/IDE specific files (you might want to keep some of these if your team uses the same IDE)
*.swp          # Vim swap files
*.swo          # Vim swap files
*.backup       # Generic backup files

# Build artifacts and distribution
build/
dist/

# Dependency directories (if you install them directly and not in a venv)
# node_modules/  # If you have a frontend part using Node.js

# Any ML model files if they are large and shouldn't be tracked
# ML Models/

# Specific files you might want to ignore
